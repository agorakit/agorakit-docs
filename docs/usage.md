# Creating groups

Create one or more groups. A welcome and a test group are often useful.

# Invite people

Invite people to one or more groups using the invite feature of each group. You can also add people directly if the already registered on your install. This is particularly useful if people have a hard time to confirm their email address and membership (trust me it happens).

# Start discussions

Each group allows one to create discussions. Within discussions and comments, you can use a special syntax to reference existing files and discussions, and mention users. Just start typing @ to mention someone (autocomplete appears) use f: to link to a file, and d: to link to a discussion.

You may also directly attach a file to a discussion. Use the "Browse..." button below the discussion form to upload a file from your computer, attach it to the group, and mention it in the discussion in one go.

# Schedule events

Each group has a calendar where you can add actions/events. You just need to set a start date and time, and an optional duration. If no duration is set, it is assumed to be 1 hour.

# Creating files

You can add file to groups directly in the files tab. Just upload one or more files, add some tags for organization. As explained above, you can also directly attach files to comments and discussions.

# Categorize content using tags

Tags (aka Labels) are very important to organize your content. You can tag anything in Agorakit (files, users, discussions, groups, actions). You can either choose to use freeform tagging (anyone can choose any tag) or restrict the tags you cant to use in each group (more like github labels for example).

In the later case, a group admin may decide which tags are allowed in the group. It is often a good idea to restrict available tags : "less is more" and "everyone has a different way to organize content, so let's stick to one way of doing it".

Group admins may also define tag colors. The colors are shared among groups.

The allowed tags can be defined in the "Admin" tab of the group, under "Tags".

Once content is tagged, it can be found as a simple overview page, showing all tags and showing all content attached to a particular tag. Great to have a big overview of your groups.
