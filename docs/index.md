# Welcome to Agorakit's documentation!


Agorakit is an open source and web based groupware for collectives to communicate, organize and store their files. It keeps everyone in your collaborative group updated with a discussion forum, agenda for events, file manager and email notifier. And most of the time Agorakit doesn't need an admin, keeping the process as horizontal as possible.
