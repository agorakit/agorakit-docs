# Welcome, we are happy to see you here !

## What is this tool ?
Agorakit is an **open source**, **web based** groupware for **collectives**. It allows groups to communicate, organize events and store their files. It keeps everyone in your collaborative group updated with a discussion forum, agenda for events, file manager and email notifier.

And most of the time Agorakit doesn't need an admin, keeping the process **as horizontal as possible**.

## Trying Agorakit
If you want to try Agorakit without installing it, go to <https://app.agorakit.org>, **create an account there and create or join some groups**.

## How to install Agorakit?
As a server admin , you might want to [install](install.md), [configure](configure.md) and later [update](update.md) Agorakit. Agorakit is written in PHP using the Laravel framework.
