# Create and manage your groups

## Create groups

Create one or more groups. A welcome and a test group are often useful.

Depending on the type of community you want to create, there are several different types of group available.

### Public groups
These groups are open to everyone, and their content is public. Anyone can create an account on the instance and join a public group. A small planet icon is displayed next to the group name.

### Private groups
These groups are by invitation only and their content is not public. Only the group's presentation page (including group photo and description text) is visible. If the group authorizes users to apply, a tab allows them to do so. A small padlock icon is displayed next to the name.

### Secret groups
These groups are completely invisible to those who don't know they exist. If you haven't been invited to one, you won't have access to it. A small crossed-out eye icon is displayed next to the name.

!!! note
    Future releases of Agorakit might include more granular control of group types and membership access. Your input is valuable to further enhance this part.

## Group settings
If you are admin of a group, you will have an "admin" tab on the group(s) you manage. There you can manage a lot of things in yout group.

### The "configuration" menu
This tab lets you add a description to your group, set the group tags, define a location (address) and set the group type (see above).

### The "tags" menu
This menu allows you to choose which tagging strategy you want in your group:

- Free tagging : anyone can tag content with any label
- Controlled tagging : you decide which tags are allowed in your group.

!!! note
        Altough free tagging looks nice, it is often a good idea to settle on  a fixed set of tags together and then stick to it in your group. "Less is more" and "everyone has a different way to organize content, so let's stick to one way of doing it".

Group admins may also define tag colors. The colors are shared among groups.

### The "features" menu
This menu allows you to enable and disable the tabs available in your group. This way you can enable or disable :

- Discussions
- Calendar
- Files
- Members
- Map

You have also the opportunity to add one custom tab to your group with a custom icon and custom HTML. Use it to include additional content that must be shared amongst all group members.

### The "permissions" menu
This menu allows you to choose what members are able to do or not in your group. This is quite self explanatory, just check the permissions you want to allow for regular members in your group. By default members have all permissions.

### The "insights" menu
This one shows you some interesting stats about your groups and some nice graphs as well.

## Invite people
Invite people to one or more groups using the invite feature of each group. You can also add people directly if the already registered on your install. This is particularly useful if people have a hard time to confirm their email address and membership (trust me it happens).

## Memberships
On this page, you can view and export the list of members of your group. You can also check if everyone has accepted an invitation to join a group. 

NOTE: The "Last activity" field shows the last time someone **wrote** something not the last time someone connected to the system. It might be misleading.
