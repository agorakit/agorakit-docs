There are many ways to contribute. 
Whether you have an hour a day or an hour a month, help is really appreciated!

## Communication
- Talk about the project to people who might need it
- Add or improve translations
- Write end-users documentation

## Technical Support
- Install it for non-technical folks
- Improve the [website](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit-website)
- Support existing users on the [Agorakit shared server](https://app.agorakit.org)
- Support folks with technical [issues](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit/issues) to help define bugs.
- Send an email if you use the tool or are considering it. We love feedback! (info (at) agorakit.org)

## Developers
- Check out [open issues](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit/issues) and [projects to initiate](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit/blob/main/ROADMAP.md). We use [trunk-based development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/).
- Backend developers with Laravel experience: add new features, fix bug, write tests, document everything. I happily accept pull requests if they pass unit tests and follow the project philosophy.
- Frontend developers with Laravel experience: Help make the UI brilliant. Fix UX as you see fit. I happily accept pull requests if they pass unit tests and follow the project philosophy. We don't want the project to become a one-page app powered by the latest "Ã  la mode" Javascript framework.
- Let's talk in the issue queue first if your idea involves big changes. Create a new issue if you want to discuss something in the roadmap. 
- Want to propose a change to the [roadmap](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit/blob/main/ROADMAP.md)? Create a pull request to solicit comments.

## Sponsorship
- Consider [donating](https://agorakit.org/en/support.php) to help me work on it.
- Help me find ways to financially support the project (sponsorship, public subsidies, etc.)
- Financial support is critical to offering a free hosted version for groups that can't afford to pay.

## Licence
All work is open source under the AGPLv3. 
That means _anyone_ who improves the project must make the changes open source as well.
We already have thousands of users who might benefit from your help.
