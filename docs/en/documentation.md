# Contribute to documentation

NOTE: New translations, editing, more visuals or examples, and any fixes are welcome!

All documentation is written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) and edited via [GitHub repo](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit-docs).

## Editing docs
- Create a GitHub account or sign in.
- Go to the [repository](https://github.com/agorakit/agorakit-docs).
- Find the Markdown files under `/docs` (and then the locale abbreviation).
- Edit the docs directly in your browser, creating a new branch and submitting a PR (against `main`) with the GitHub.com UI.

For more advanced editing, fork the repository and submit pull requests to `main`.  See the README to build the docs on localhost.
