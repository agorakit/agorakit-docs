# Using Agorakit


## Start discussions

Each group allows you to create discussions. In discussions and comments, you can use special syntax to refer to existing files and discussions, and mention users.

Choose a group and from the "Discussions" tab you can "Create a discussion". Mention a title and text as a minimum. You can also add keywords or tags to better classify discussions and help others find their way around.

- Just type @ to mention someone (autocomplete appears).

You can also attach a file directly to a discussion. Use the "Browse..." button below the discussion form to download a file from your computer, attach it to the group and mention it in the discussion all at once.


### Attach a file
In the text editor, you can attach a file by dragging and dropping it, or by clicking on the "image" button, which allows you to insert not only an image, but any type of file. When you drag and drop a file, the system automatically sends your file and inserts a reference to it at the cursor position, in the form of an f:xx (xx being the file reference). When your discussion or comment is displayed, a preview of the file is automatically generated. 

The file also appears in your group's "files" tab.

### Mention another person
Simply type @ in the text editor, and a list of group members will appear, allowing you to mention one or more people. They'll instantly receive an e-mail with your comment. Handy when you need a quick answer to your question.


## Schedule events

Each group has a calendar where you can add actions/events. You just need to set a start date and time, and an optional duration. If no duration is set, it is assumed to be 1 hour.

## Upload files and share links
You can add file to groups directly in the files tab. Just upload one or more files, add some tags for organization. As explained above, you can also directly attach files to comments and discussions.

## Categorize content using tags

Tags (aka Labels) are very important to organize your content. You can tag anything in Agorakit (files, users, discussions, groups, actions). Group admins can either choose to use freeform tagging (anyone can choose any tag) or restrict the tags you can use in each group (more like github labels for example).

Once content is tagged, it can be found as a simple overview page, showing all tags and showing all content attached to a particular tag. Great to have a big overview of your groups.


## Last step : profit !

(or in some cases, revolution!)
