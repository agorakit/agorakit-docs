# Welcome to Agorakit

Agorakit is an **open source**, **Web-based** groupware for **collectives**. It allows groups to collaborate, organize events, and store files. It keeps everyone updated with a discussion forum, agenda, file manager, and email notifier.

Most of the time, Agorakit doesn't even need an admin, keeping the process **as horizontal as possible**.

If you are looking for ways to contribute (great!), check the [contribution guide](contribute.md).

## Try Agorakit
If you want to try Agorakit without installing it, go to <https://app.agorakit.org> to create an account and then create or join some groups.

For guidance, check the [user guide](usage.md) or [group owner guide](group.md).

Server admins can alternatively [install](install.md) or [upgrade](upgrade.md) it themselves.

## Mission Statement
Agorakit offers a complete toolset for a community to effectively self-organize that encourages cohesion at a sustainably small scale while supporting continuous change. It supports good governance by providing strong individual & group protections, enabling emergent leadership, and facilitating group alignment & mediation.

## Beliefs
To stay aligned on how we achieve our mission, Agorakit subscribes to these core beliefs:

1. Communities should **only** be divided by individual choices: interest, labor, location, or belief (_except_ beliefs that create _additional_ divisions or restrict those individual choices).
2. Sustainable communities **must** support diversity, equity, inclusion, & accessibility, which requires an accountable power structure within the software and that the community owns its own data.
3. Communities require trust, which requires the investment of time between individuals. Therefore, you **cannot** create community that is frictionless, fully automated, or infinitely scalable.
4. Every community is unique and its software should reflect that, but community management should not require programming plugins or themes.
5. The open Web is critical to the future of humanity and is best supported through standards-based interoperability, strong data privacy, and platform transferability.
