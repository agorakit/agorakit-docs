# Agorakit: simplified collaboration for collectives

Agorakit is an **open source**, **Web-based** groupware for **collectives**. It allows groups to communicate, organize events, and store their files. It keeps everyone in your collaborative group updated with a discussion forum, agenda for events, file manager, and email notifier.

Most of the time, Agorakit doesn't even need an admin, keeping the process **as horizontal as possible**.
