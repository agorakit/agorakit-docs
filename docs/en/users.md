# User types

Agorakit offers different types of user. Here they are, in order of permissions, from the most extensive to the most restricted: 

## Instance administrator
A user with full access rights to an Agorakit instance (installation). This person can do everything: 
- access all groups, including secret groups
- modify installation settings
- modify and delete any content


## Group administrator
Anyone who creates a group automatically becomes its administrator. This allows you to :
- modify group settings, including member permissions
- access the complete list of participants, including e-mail addresses
- promote any member to admin status
- change any member's status, including removal from the group
- modify and delete any group content

## Group member
Any member of a group has at least the right to view all group content. They may also, depending on the permissions defined for the group in question :
- create discussions
- create calendar events
- add files
- invite new participants

## Guest member
In the case of a closed group: when a user has been invited by e-mail to join a group, he receives guest status. As soon as he confirms the request, he becomes an effective member of the group.

## Group applicant
When a person requests to join a closed group, they are given candidate status. One of the group administrators must accept or reject the application.

## De-registered / deleted
This status is assigned to people who have deleted their account from the Agorakit instance.

## Refused
This status is assigned to people who have declined an invitation to join the group. We strongly advise you not to contact them again about the group, as they wish, unless of course it's a false move on their part :-)

## Blacklisted
This status is assigned to a person who can no longer join the group.
