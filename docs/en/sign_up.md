## Accessing Agorakit

To use Agorakit, simply connect to the Agorakit server you're using.

You first need to determine whether you're using the shared agora on https://app.agorakit.org (a server provided by Agorakit developers for your testing and free use) or your organization's own agora. In the former case, simply go to https://app.agorakit.org, in the latter, you'll have received a link to connect.


## Create an account
On most servers, you can freely create a new user account. If you can't create an account on a particular server, registration has been deactivated. In this case, you must receive an invitation from the server administrator to join the server.

Creating an account is very easy: simply click on "Register" and enter your name and e-mail address. You'll receive a link to connect directly in your mailbox. Check your spam folder if you don't receive anything after a few minutes.

## The special case of the first user account
If you create a user account on a new server (without an existing user), you will be the server administrator (superuser) on that server.


NOTE: You must be able to send an e-mail before your account can be validated.


## Login
If you already have a user account, you can log in. Click on the login button, enter your username or e-mail address and your password. If you've forgotten your password, leave the 'password' box blank and the system will send you a login link by e-mail.
