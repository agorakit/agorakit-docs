# Create and manage your groups

## Create groups

Create one or more groups. A welcome and a test group are often useful.

You can choose the type of group to create

- An open group has public content and is open to memberships
- A private group has private content and membership is invite only (admin need to accept new members)
- A secret group is not shown anywhere except to existing members. Perfect for your next plot :-)

!!! note
    Future releases of Agorakit might include more granular control of group types and membership access. Your input is valuable to further enhance this part.

## Group settings
If you are admin of a group, you will have an "admin" tab on the group(s) you manage. There you can manage a lot of things in yout group.

### The "configuration" menu
This tab lets you add a description to your group, set the group tags, define a location (address) and set the group type (see above).

### The "tags" menu
This menu allows you to choose which tagging strategy you want in your group:

- Free tagging : anyone can tag content with any label
- Controlled tagging : you decide which tags are allowed in your group.

!!! note
        Altough free tagging looks nice, it is often a good idea to stick together for a fixed set of tags and then stick to it in your group. "less is more" and "everyone has a different way to organize content, so let's stick to one way of doing it".

Group admins may also define tag colors. The colors are shared among groups.


## Invite people

Invite people to one or more groups using the invite feature of each group. You can also add people directly if the already registered on your install. This is particularly useful if people have a hard time to confirm their email address and membership (trust me it happens).

## Memberships
