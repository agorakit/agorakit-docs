To use Agorakit, simply connect to the Agorakit server you are using.

This can be either the shared instance at https://app.agorakit.org ("name your price" instance available for your tests and for collectives), or a server you have installed or someone manages for you.

## Registering a new user
On most servers, you can freely create a new user account. If you cannot create an account on a particular server it means registration has been disabled. In this case you need an invitation from the server admin to join the server.

## The special case of the first user account
If you register a user account on a new server (one without any existing user), you will be the server admin (super user) on this server.


NOTE: You need to have email sending working in order to validate your account.
